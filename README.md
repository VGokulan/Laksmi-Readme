# Lakshmi Smart Waste Management System

## Overview

Even in developing areas, garbage overflow and street littering persist despite existing waste collection systems. Poor waste management practices contribute to environmental degradation and pose serious public health risks.

The **Lakshmi Smart Waste Management System** is an innovative solution designed to address these urban challenges. By leveraging real-time sensor data and predictive analytics, Lakshmi optimizes waste collection, prevents bin overflow, ensures timely responses to cleanliness issues, and enhances both operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.
